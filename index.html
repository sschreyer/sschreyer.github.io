    <br>
    Hello! I am currently building this website, which may take a while.
    <br>
    <br>
    Once I am done, I intend for it to contain information about all of my
    projects. These include my novels, as well as any music or games that I may 
    be working on. There is likely to be some professional information related
    to my (potential) future career as a Software Engineer housed here, too.
    <br>
    <br>

    In short, this is a place to gather in one place information about who I am
    and what I do. Please bear with me as I take the time to set things up
    (if you are here very early, you will no doubt notice things that are 
    broken, or that were copied from a tutorial.)
</p>
