    Hello! I am Samuel Schreyer, and I study computer science. Welcome 
    to my website!
    <br>
    <br>
    This website is a place to catalogue the various software projects that 
    I am working on, as well as things like novels or music that I do in 
    my spare time. 
</p>

<h2>
    What am I working on right now?
</h2>

<p>
    Over the summer I'm working on a top secret project that hopefully I will
    be able to share more about soon. 

    Before that, I was working on two other projects that are kind of on hold 
    for the time being:
    <br>
    Partition, a web app that can be used to plan your schedule.
    My hope for it is that it can be the app that I wish existed right now.
    While there are many planning apps, I still haven't found one that 
    feels right for me. Maybe this can be that app. 
    <br>
    A simple FPS game in c++, using the OpenGL api. I haven't made much progress yet 
    due to work and uni commitments, but I plan to work on it over 2022.

    And of course, I'm (slowly) building this website!
