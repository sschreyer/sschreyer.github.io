    Hello! I am Samuel Schreyer, and I study computer science. Welcome 
    to my website!
    <br>
    <br>
    This website is a place to catalogue the various software projects that 
    I am working on, as well as things like novels or music that I do in 
    my spare time.

            What am I working on right now?

        <p>
            Over the summer I'm working on a top secret project that hopefully I will
            be able to share more about soon. 

            Before that, I was working on two other projects that are kind of on hold 
            for the time being:
            <br>
            Partition, a web app that can be used to plan your schedule.
            My hope for it is that it can be the app that I wish existed right now.
            While there are many planning apps, I still haven't found one that 
            feels right for me. Maybe this can be that app. 
            <br>
            A simple FPS game in c++, using the OpenGL api. I haven't made much progress yet 
            due to work and uni commitments, but I plan to work on it over 2022.

            And of course, I'm (slowly) building this website!

            An interesting question!
