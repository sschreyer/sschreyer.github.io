<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

<!-- I have no clue how to set up a html doc, so I'm trying this first-->
<p>
    Hello! I am currently building this website, which may take a while.
    <br>
    <br>
    Once I am done, I intend for it to contain information about all of my
    projects. These include my software projects, as well as any music or novels that I may 
    be working on. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In short, this is a place to gather in one place information about who I am
    and what I do. Please bear with me as I take the time to set things up.
    I had a little bit more content here originally, but never had the time 
    to fully set everything up.
