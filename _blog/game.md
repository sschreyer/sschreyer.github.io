title: Simple Shooter 1 â€” So it Begins
type: Game Development
---
I began this project as a way to focus on my graphics programming skills. 
It's a simple shooter written in c++ using the OpenGL API.

I'm going to be documenting the process here, with some technical details. 
However, this is not intended to be a guide or a texbook. I will probably 
reference the excellent work by Joey de Vries at LearnOpenGL 
(https://learnopengl.com) for those that want to learn how to work with OpenG, 

To begin with, I set up two simple walls that you can see in the video below:

These will eventually end up without the colour on them (i.e. as stone walls), 
but I was playing around with mixing colours and textures and thought that they 
looked pretty cool.
