# About page

I'm Samuel Schreyer, a programmer, (unpublished) author, and musician among other things (those are most of the things, though). I'm currently studying computer science and arts at the University of New South Wales. 

I have quite a few interests, and along with these interests comes a variety of projects. This website is a place to gather information about them (and me). 

This is quite short right now, but hopefully it will grow in time. Well, that's it then. Thanks for reading this :)
