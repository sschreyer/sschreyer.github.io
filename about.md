# About page

I'm Samuel Schreyer, an (unpublished) author, musician, and programmer, among other things (those are most of the things, though). I'm currently studying computer science and maths at the University of New South Wales, hoping to go on to do further study in the area of artificial intelligence. 

I have quite a few interests, and along with these interests comes a variety of projects. This website is a place to gather information about them (and me). 

This is quite short right now, but hopefully it will grow in time. Well, that's it then. Thanks for reading this :)
