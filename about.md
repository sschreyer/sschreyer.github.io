# About page

I'm Samuel Schreyer, a programmer, (unpublished) author, and musician among other things (those are most of the things, though). I'm currently studying computer science and arts at the University of New South Wales, where I teach as a casual academic at CSE. Over the summer I am working on a top secret game project that hopefully I can share more details about soon.

I have quite a few interests, and along with these interests comes a variety of projects. This website is a place to gather information about them (and me). 

You can find my Github <a href="https://github.com/sschreyer">here</a>

This is quite short right now, but hopefully it will grow in time. Well, that's it then. Thanks for reading this :)
